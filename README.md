IRNAS - NodeMCU DEVKIT V1.0  
==============
The NodeMCU is gate tool for WiFi development, but it has some issues. The biggest issue for us at Institute Irans was the power consumption problem. Thanks to the open-source nature of the NodeMCU project we were able to improve the schematics and save a bit more power. Now the Irnas-NodeMCU is the great tool even if you want to power it up from the battery. 

For further details please check the [PDF schematics](https://github.com/IRNAS/nodemcu-devkit-v1.0/blob/nodeMCU-irnas-v0.1/Project%20Outputs%20for%20NODEMCU_DEVKIT_V1.0/NodeMCU-irnas-v0_1.PDF) of the board. All issues with the latest release can be found in the [Issue](https://github.com/IRNAS/nodemcu-devkit-v1.0/issues) section of the repository.

### Latest release: [v0.1](https://github.com/IRNAS/nodemcu-devkit-v1.0/releases/tag/v0.1)

Development kit for ESP8266.

It will make ESP8266 more easy. With a micro USB cable, you can connect NodeMCU devkit to your laptop and flash it without any trouble, just like Arduino.

![DEVKIT](https://github.com/IRNAS/nodemcu-devkit-v1.0/blob/nodeMCU-irnas-v0.1/Pics/irnas_nodemcu.jpg)

It is an open hardware, with ESP-12-E core [32Mbits(4MBytes) flash version].

## How to flash

There are several ways to flash youre Irnas-NodeMCU the first one is using nodemcu-flasher and the second one is using arduino:

UPDATE
New nodemcu-flasher is released.
Bug fixed. please use latest software and re-flash.
